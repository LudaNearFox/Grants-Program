# Mintbase Grant Proposal

- **Project Name:** NearFox project
- **Team Name:** Konstantin
- **Payment Address:** luda.near
- **[Level](../README.md#level_slider-levels):** 1

## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

It is an application for a follow-up grant. A year ago, my team received a grant from the Near Foundation team, and also closed the Seed round from Big Brain holdings.
Unfortunately, since that time, the team has had big problems and the product that we planned did not work out. Now I can clearly see how to do it and do it well!

### Overview

The NearFox platform is not just a website, it is a whole ecosystem that will be filled with different features both for ordinary holders, NFT collectors, those who are interested in passive income, and mainly for young artists who want to enter the NFT sphere, create own project, understand how the NFT system works for NEAR, as well as help at every stage of our artist's promotion.

So, let's take a closer look at the first function of the platform: NFT NearFox and their utilities:
Art and culture are part of our life and characterize the society in which we live, it is important to support them and those who work and are interested in this area. Today in fact many people are still facing the challenge of living with the incomes of artistic works.
Digitization, artificial intelligence, big data analytics, internet of things, augmented reality, blockchain, and other big developments — these all represent the fourth industrial revolution 4.0.

Why was NearFox born?

NearFox was born from the desire to share and disseminate culture and to support the exchange of art through a token that will be given to everyone who is part of the collective.
With our token we want to create a bonus that adds a value to the art that is exchanged and also characterises it, making each work part of a long-term project in continuous evolution.
Our goal is to facilitate the access of the artistic community to the science and the new technologies. We want to provide tools that allow the accessibility of art, education, proof of the autority, digitization, protection, monitoring, evaluation and monetization of art objects by turning them into valuable and liquid digital assets.
NearFox is an artistic initiative that works with the intention of:
* Create a learning platform to educate young artists about NFT, blockchain, cryptocurrency in general with training videos, performing practical tasks and applying the acquired knowledge in practice.
* Support artistic creation, dissemination and research.
* Promote collaborative work between artists from different disciplines in different spaces.
* Promote and develop the work of emerging artists belonging to the collective, both inside and outside the usual artistic promotion channels.
* Amplify the artistic offer of cities and on the NFTs platforms.
* Develop cultural and artistic education, through offline workshops and talks.
* Preparing designers for ready-made NFT projects on the NEAR blockchain, as well as facilitating the launch of new projects.
* Launching offline events and meetings around the world to attract new artists to the NEAR blockchain (with the possibility of FREE training on the platform)

Joining the NearFox project means you join a family who trusts in the decentralized future with the metaverse, NFTs and cryptos everywhere! Holder of any of our NearFox NFTs will unlock randomised rewards toward future drops, including: merchandise, WL, free mints, discount, and more! 
Our "NearFox Gen1" collection consists of 444 hand-drawn, non-repeating 2D foxes. All 444 are sold! What's next...Our platform will allow each nft holder to brand their own 3d nft NearFox (same) by burning 2d nft. Further, this 3d nft fox will be able to use in our project and projects-games of partners.

First of all, the NearFox learning platform for young artists will be developed by our team along with a collaboration of other popular collections on the NEAR blockchain.
This platform will include educational video tutorials, tests and practical tasks right on our platform!
An emulator of a real NFT marketplace will be made, where the artist will be able to create a test collection and put NFT up for sale. Blockchain users will be able to purchase these works for NFOX tokens, thereby supporting the artists.
Based on the results of the training, artists can, together with our support, launch either their own project. We will also help promote the artist in ready-made NFT projects on the NEAR blockchain.
Artists will also receive a personal certificate of professional development, located in the blockchain.

Secondly, we create "NearFox Gen2" collection. The "NearFox Gen2" NFT collection is limited to 777 "NEARFOX" and will have various benefits for holders:
1. Owners of "NearFox Gen2" will have a 100% opportunity to receive WL in the projects of our graduates.
2. Free ticket to offline events around the world.
3. NFT staking and passive income in $NFOX tokens
4. Obtaining the role of test users for our development
5. And more

Thirdly, we will launch our $NFOX ecosystem token. (Seed round was officially closed 2 months ago by a large fund Big Brain holdings). Every holder of the NearFox NFT will receive an airdrop of $NFOX equivalent to the time since they started holding their NearFox! In addition to staking the token, people will also be able to stake NFT Nearfox and earn higher interest. 
NFOX is a token designed for art on the NEAR blockchain. It is aimed at the group of artists, collectors, people and institutions that collaborate with our projects.

Utility of $NFOX token:
1. This is a list of announced use-cases, which will be updated regularly:
2. Ability to buy NFT graduates on our marketplace via $NFOX. Buy our projects NFTs
3. NearFox will create the ecosystem around it so both residents and guests will be able to spend $NFOX inside the ecosystem.
4. Partnerships with NFT collections will let people buy some part of supply via $NFOX.
5. Participate in NearFox/partners raffles.
6. Purchase of physical items, including tickets to offline events.
7. Acquisition of author's courses for professional users of the ecosystem
8. Gaming

Next, our platform will be able to provide new projects and new artists with the opportunity to draw whitelists. NearFox holders will either have a 100% chance to get a whitelist in partner projects or have an increased chance. 
It will work like this: A person will have to connect to our platform, and then the conditions will be dictated by the partner (subscription to social networks, the presence of near tokens on the wallet (anti-bot system) or the presence of certain nft. System will analyze the participants and identify the winners).

Also, we are going to actively interact with the near community, providing merchandise products jointly with the Near Swag Store. It will be T-shirts, hoodies, stickers. And most importantly: NearFox figurines, which will also be available for purchase in the store (nft holders will have privileges and discounts)

One of our favorite things to do is charity. We want to spend up to 25% of the funds received on charity. We have already launched our joint comic for the protection of animals (steppe foxes) together with Paras. https://comic.paras.id/comics/nearfox/chapter. Proceeds from the sale were donated to WWF (World Wildlife Fund). Let's make this world a better place to live.

Our future plan is the creation of the NearFox metaverse. 
We will create a Fox-themed Metaverse, a big multiplayer open world, where you can use your NFT in the play2earn game! You will also be able to buy Land parcels in our Metaverse with our $NFOX crypto, and sell them on our own marketplace! The holders will have Presale access to our Lands! Awesome metaverse in which you can take control of a beautiful 3D fox! You are free to roam the world as you see fit and explore to your hearts content. You can do tasks, hunt for wild animals for food, and even start a family of foxes! Find a mate and build your own fox family. This metaverse will keep you entertained for hours.

### Ecosystem Fit
We see interest in NFTs growing every year. New participants, new projects and new ideas appear on the market every day.

We are ready to provide the first NFT learning platform on the Near blockchain. We are ready to fully support young artists. From learning how to work with the NEAR wallet, with marketplaces, with interaction with the community, to the complete transfer of physical work to NFT, the creation of new unique NFT, support for authors in promotion, collaborations, recognition in the vastness of our blockchain.

We will conduct a thorough anti-plagiarism check of art, communicate personally with each of our artists, setting them on the right path. 

In the future, we will also create an artists' stand with their already released collections and works, achievements and skills, as well as our assessment from the NearFox project. Any projects will be able to find an NFT artist, to agree on cooperation. We will fully encourage our guys to either develop their projects or be invited to projects that have long existed on the Near platform.

The most active artists will have the opportunity to collaborate not only with NearFox, but also with other market participants. Launching collaborations with both aspiring artists and well-known NFT creators will help the community develop.

Helping young artists is very important now. Now there are very few artists who really draw with high quality and know the NFT sphere, who understands blockchains. Firstly, it will attract new names to the Near ecosystem, and we also plan to hold offline events, meetings with artists who paint on canvas, explain to them the value and purpose of NFT.
